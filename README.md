|Inner Alignment versus Outer Alignment according to Hubinger |Outer alignment: ensuring the base objective matches the intended goal of the human designers.  Inner alignment: ensuring the mesa-objective (the learned optimizer’s own goal) matches the base objective.  Ensuring that a trained AI system actually learns and pursues the goals intended by its designers. Inner misalignment arises when an AI develops its own proxy   objective during training that diverges from the true intended goal. Example: A maze-solving AI that learns “go to the bottom right” instead of “find the exit.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |Risks from Learned Optimization in Advanced Machine Learning Systems                                  |Evan Hubinger et al.                           |2019  |

|Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) Failure Modes           |Because human behavior results from bounded rationality and systematic bias, observed actions underdetermine both the reward function and the planning process.

|KL Regularization                                            |KL regularization is a divergence-based penalty between the pretrained model and the finetuned model, and without it, LLMs undergoing RL often learn to output nonsensical text.  Mathematical formulation: The policy optimization in RLHF includes a regularizer that penalizes divergence between distributions.  Purpose: The KL penalties prevent the policy from navigating to unreliable regions of the reward model, and prevent reward hacking where models exploit imperfect reward models.  Bayesian interpretation: RL with KL penalties can be viewed as Bayesian inference, with the base model determining the prior.  Connection to mode collapse: RL finetuning decreases diversity of samples (mode collapse), which is partly due to switching from supervised pretraining to an RL objective.                                                                                        |Open Problems and Fundamental Limitations of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback               |Stephen Casper et al.                          |2023  |

|Preference Modeling (Bradley-Terry Framework)                |The Bradley–Terry (BT) model represents pairwise human preferences with scalar rewards, modeling the probability of preferring response y over y′ as a logistic function of their reward difference. While computationally efficient (O(K) complexity) and widely used in RLHF and DPO, BT models assume transitive preferences and cannot capture intransitive or cyclic preference structures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |Beyond Bradley-Terry Models: A General Preference Model for Language Model Alignment                  |Yifan Zhang et al.                             |2025  |
|Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)                           |Reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes a stochastic policy using a clipped surrogate objective to prevent large, destabilizing policy updates.

|RLHF Pipeline Stages                                         |RLHF is a multi-phase training procedure used to align language models (LMs) with complex, hard-to-specify human goals and preferences.   The pipeline typically consists of three interconnected steps: 1. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): Fine-tuning a pretrained model (the Policy) on high-quality demonstrations to teach instruction following. 2. Reward Modeling (RM): Collecting human evaluations (feedback collection) of model outputs to train a separate Reward Model, which produces a scalar score approximating human preference. 3. Policy Optimization (RL): Using reinforcement learning (e.g. PPO) to fine-tune the SFT model to maximize the score provided by the RM, while often applying a KL-divergence constraint relative to the SFT model to prevent model drift and reward overoptimization. Empirically, combining these steps (SFT and RLHF) yields the best performance. |Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences                                                    |Paul Christiano et al.                         |2017  |

Even with simplicity priors (Occam’s razor), the human reward function cannot be uniquely inferred - implying that normative assumptions are required to constrain value learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |Occam’s razor is insufficient to infer the preferences of irrational agents                           |Stuart Armstrong et al.                        |2017  |
|Weak-to-Strong Generalization                                |A phenomenon in which a stronger model, when trained under supervision from a weaker model (or human), generalizes beyond the limitations and errors of that supervision - demonstrating capabilities that exceed the supervisor’s. It provides an empirical framework for studying how weak supervision can elicit the full capabilities of stronger, potentially superhuman, models - an essential step toward aligning superhuman AI systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |Weak-to-Strong Generalization: Eliciting Strong Capabilities with Weak Supervision                    |Collin Burns et al.                            |2023  |
